### Features
- **Password Protection:** Prompt for a password to unlock the folder.
- **Permission Control:** Change folder permissions to allow or restrict access.
- **Folder Visibility:** Hide or unhide the folder based on the password status.

```ps1
curl -o FolderLock.ps1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krishnazzz/Scripts/main/Folder-Protection-Script-for-Windows/FolderLock.ps1
```
2. Run the script in PowerShell.
3. Enter the password when prompted:
   - Correct password will unhide the folder and set permissions to allow access.
   - Incorrect password will keep the folder hidden and restricted.
